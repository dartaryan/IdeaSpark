# Product Brief: IdeaSpark

## Executive Summary

IdeaSpark transforms PassportCard's innovation culture by solving the "innovation black hole" problem - where employee ideas disappear or lack credibility. The platform provides a unified system where employees go from initial idea → AI-structured PRD → auto-generated working prototype in PassportCard's exact design language. By combining conversational AI guidance (Gemini 2.5 Flash) with open-lovable's instant prototyping capabilities and DaisyUI components styled in PassportCard's brand (Red #e10514), employees gain both autonomy to develop ideas independently and credibility through tangible, professionally-designed demos. Success means ideas are taken seriously because they arrive complete: structured requirements + visual proof of concept, all within PassportCard's brand ecosystem.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

Employee ideas at PassportCard face a credibility gap. When someone proposes an innovation, they lack the tools to transform abstract concepts into tangible proposals that leadership can evaluate seriously. Ideas expressed through emails or meetings get lost, dismissed as "interesting but unclear," or die waiting for resources to prove viability.

### Problem Impact

- **Emotional Toll:** Employees stop sharing ideas after repeated dismissals, killing innovation culture
- **Lost Opportunity:** Valuable innovations never surface because proposers can't make them credible
- **Resource Waste:** Leadership can't evaluate vague ideas, leading to either premature rejection or expensive exploration of unclear concepts

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Informal Channels (Email/Slack):** Ideas lack structure and disappear into threads
- **Traditional Innovation Programs:** Require executive pitches that intimidate employees or committees that create months-long delays
- **Generic Prototyping Tools:** Produce demos that don't reflect PassportCard's brand, making them feel like external projects rather than internal innovations

### Proposed Solution

IdeaSpark creates a three-phase pipeline where AI acts as the employee's co-creator:

**Phase 1 - Idea Submission:** Guided wizard captures problem, solution, and impact with AI enhancement for clarity

**Phase 2 - PRD Development:** Conversational AI assistant (inspired by BMAD methodology) guides employees through creating comprehensive Product Requirements Documents section-by-section, making professional specification writing accessible to everyone

**Phase 3 - Auto-Generated Prototype:** Upon PRD completion, the system automatically generates a working React prototype using open-lovable technology, locked to PassportCard's DaisyUI theme. Employees can refine through natural language chat, maintaining brand consistency while perfecting their vision.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Prototype-Before-Approval:** Unlike traditional processes where prototypes come after budget approval, IdeaSpark generates working demos during the PRD phase, giving employees ammunition for their pitch

2. **Brand-Locked Design:** Every prototype uses PassportCard's exact design system (DaisyUI + custom theme), making ideas look like they already belong in the product ecosystem

3. **Autonomous Empowerment:** Employees need zero design or development skills - AI guides the entire journey from concept to working demo

4. **Credibility Stack:** Leadership receives not just an idea, but a complete package: problem analysis + structured requirements + branded prototype, transforming evaluation from "sounds interesting" to "let's implement this"

## Target Users

### Primary Users

**The Idea Creators** - PassportCard employees across all departments and seniority levels who experience problems or see opportunities for innovation. This includes:

**Maya - Frontline Employee with Solutions**
- **Role:** Customer Service Representative, 3 years at PassportCard
- **Problem Experience:** Sees recurring customer pain points daily but lacks credibility or tools to propose solutions that leadership will take seriously
- **Success Vision:** Transform observations into professional PRDs + branded prototypes independently, earning recognition for valuable contributions
- **Key Need:** Autonomy + Credibility (tools that make her ideas look professional without requiring technical skills)

**David - Technical Problem Solver**
- **Role:** Backend Developer, 5 years at PassportCard
- **Problem Experience:** Identifies technical improvements but has no bandwidth to prototype while shipping features; ideas die in notes
- **Success Vision:** Convert technical concepts into structured PRDs + working prototypes without leaving development work or needing design resources
- **Key Need:** Speed + Autonomy (rapid idea exploration without approval overhead)

**Rachel - Manager with Strategic Vision**
- **Role:** Product Manager, Insurance Products Division
- **Problem Experience:** Articulates market opportunities well but can't demonstrate solutions visually; PowerPoint mockups lack credibility
- **Success Vision:** Transform strategic insights into PassportCard-branded prototypes that secure executive buy-in and budget allocation
- **Key Need:** Credibility + Professional Polish (demos that look production-ready, not generic)

### Secondary Users

**Innovation Gatekeepers (Sarah - Innovation Program Manager)**
